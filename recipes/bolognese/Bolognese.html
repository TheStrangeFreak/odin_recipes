    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely!
        <br>To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. 
        You can also substitute the balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.</p>
